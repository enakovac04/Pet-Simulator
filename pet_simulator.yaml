  Our project is a pet simulator. It supports different pet types and allows the 
  user to take care of their chosen pet. They can participate in a variety of 
  activities to keep their pet happy, healthy, and energized. These activities
  include, but are not limited to, feeding your pet, playing with your pet, and
  training your pet. If you are not careful, your pet will die, so this simulator
  requires your full attention.
